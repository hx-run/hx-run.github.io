# Engineering Notebook

A personal **engineering notebook** where I document what I build, break, fix, and learn while working with modern software systems.

This is not a tutorial blog.
It is a working log of real-world engineering: bugs, decisions, experiments, and field-tested practices.

---

## Scope

This notebook primarily focuses on hands-on development with:

* **Backend**: Node.js, NestJS, NATS, event-driven systems
* **Frontend**: React, React Native, Electron
* **Infrastructure**: Docker, tooling, build systems
* **Engineering Practice**: system design decisions, performance trade-offs

Alongside code, I also capture practical notes on building leverage as an engineer: systems thinking, B2B work, and lessons extracted from books and experience.

## Structure

The content is organized into four core sections, each with a clear responsibility.

### Logbook

Short, atomic engineering entries:

* Bugs encountered in real projects and their fixes
* Debugging notes and edge cases
* Framework and tooling gotchas (NestJS, NATS, Docker, React, etc.)
* Small but important technical discoveries

Think of this as a **flight recorder for engineering work**.

---

### Notes

More structured technical write-ups:

* Best practices within the chosen tech stack
* Design and implementation decisions
* Performance comparisons and trade-offs
* Opinionated but experience-backed guidance

Notes often evolve from repeated Logbook entries.

---

### Fieldcraft

Practical knowledge learned in the field, beyond code:

* Personal branding for engineers
* System-building for sustainable income
* B2B work, freelancing, and client acquisition
* Delegation, leverage, and decision-making
* Actionable insights distilled from books and reading

This section captures what is usually *learned the hard way*.

### Labs

Hands-on experiments and shipped work:

* Open source projects
* Proofs of concept (POCs)
* Architecture experiments
* Tooling and infrastructure spikes

Labs answer the question: **“What did I actually build?”**
